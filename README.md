## User Story

#### What is it?
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
#### Why did I make this?
I made this to practice using jQuery and moment.js to create a simple calendar application.

#### How does it work?
The user can enter events into the text area and click the save button to save the event to local storage. The events will persist even after the page is refreshed. The time blocks are color coded to indicate whether the time block is in the past, present, or future.
